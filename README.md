# CarPark
There are two simple buttons, one to store the user's last known location in sharedpref (usable from Android shortcuts as well), and the other will open up the Maps app to navigate to the previously saved location.
It's really simple and handy if you forgot where you parked your car :)
(Using with Samsung routines is a really good automation practice)
